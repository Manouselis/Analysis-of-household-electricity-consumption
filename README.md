# Analysis-of-household-electricity-consumption
The task of this assignment is to analyse the provided consumption data and extract information about the corresponding consumer behaviour.

Indicatively one can:
1. Analyse the total consumption data on a weekly basis for the whole period they cover, and investigate the resulting changes:
   - due to the difference between working/non-working days
   - due to differences in the time of year
   - different time zones within the day
2. Analyse the consumption data for the individual appliances available, and investigate:
   - the ratio of the consumption of these appliances to the total consumption of the installation.
   - the variations in the use of these appliances on working/non-working days and due to differences in the time of year.
  
Additional analysis is considered a bonus.

#### Notes
1. The provided dataset requires some pre-processing in order to deal with poor data quality or missing samples. 
2. Each student was assigned with data from one house (out of 21 houses). However, the house number is not provided. Thus, one part of the assignment is for the student to correctly identify the house number, using exclusively the provided data. Essentially, rigorous analysis of the samples is required in order to correctly estimate  the house number.
