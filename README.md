# Analysis-of-household-electricity-consumption
The task of this assignment is to analyse the provided consumption data and extract information about the corresponding consumer behaviour.

Indicatively one can:
1. Analyse the total consumption data on a weekly basis for the whole period they cover, and investigate the resulting changes:
   - due to the difference between working/non-working days
   - due to differences in the time of year
   - different time zones within the day
2. Analyse the consumption data for the individual appliances available, and investigate:
   - the ratio of the consumption of these appliances to the total consumption of the installation.
   - the variations in the use of these appliances on working/non-working days and due to differences in the time of year.
  
Obviously, any additional analysis you think would provide more information on the energy consumption in this particular facility will be appreciated.
